            <h1 class="bottom-title">Child Punishment Mechanism Sparks Ethical Concerns</h1>
            <p class="bottom-text">
                The CLAM-X chip’s trial has drawn criticism for its punishment system targeting children’s emotions. By monitoring emotional responses, it uses neural feedback to simulate violent punishment during acts of aggression or defiance, aiming to curb undesirable behavior.

                Experts warn this may harm emotional development, causing trauma and fostering fear rather than understanding. Critics say standardized regulation ignores individual differences, stripping children of emotional autonomy and expression, and hindering healthy growth.

                Excessive intervention, they add, risks turning children into “emotional machines,” with long-term impacts on morality and human rights. Many urge a review to ensure the mechanism meets ethical and human rights standards.

            <p class="bottom-text">
                As the CLAM-X chip spreads across Seoul, public opposition to its emotion-control mechanism is mounting. Thousands recently took to the streets, demanding the government and tech companies immediately stop using the technology, particularly its neural feedback punishment for children’s violent behavior.

                Protesters argue that the chip’s standardized emotional monitoring strips people of emotional autonomy and poses risks to children’s emotional growth and mental health. Some parents and experts fear it could hinder normal emotional expression and even cause psychological trauma.

                While most demonstrations remained peaceful, minor clashes with police occurred at some gatherings. The city government has yet to respond, though signs suggest officials are reassessing the technology’s social impact.

                As protests grow, citizens are raising broader questions about the CLAM-X chip’s legality and ethics.

            <h1 class="bottom-title">CLAM-X Custom Edition for Chaebols Sparks Backlash</h1>
            <p class="bottom-text">
                A leaked report reveals that the CLAM-X chip has not only a standard version but also a high-end edition tailored for South Korea’s chaebols. This custom version is optimized to regulate emotions in ways that ensure smoother social and business interactions for the wealthy.

                The revelation has fueled public doubts over fairness and transparency, with many arguing it deepens social inequality. Experts say it violates the principle of technological inclusivity, potentially widening class divides and eroding trust in technology.

                Ethicists warn it could be used to entrench elite power, infringe on personal freedoms, and threaten social stability. CLAM-X has yet to respond, and the lack of transparency has intensified calls for government investigation.

            <h1 class="bottom-title">Expressionless Children in Seoul Raise Concerns</h1>
            <p class="bottom-text">
                Recently, a group of expressionless, vacant-eyed children appeared on the streets of Seoul, their lifeless demeanor drawing public attention. Witnesses reported that the children showed no emotional reactions, appearing to be in a state of mental “numbness.”

                Experts suggest this phenomenon may be linked to the CLAM-X chip, which regulates children’s emotions through neural feedback. Some parents fear that excessive intervention could strip children of genuine emotions, making them more mechanical.

                Witnesses described the children as “walking corpses,” wandering among crowds with hollow gazes, almost no facial changes, and no interaction with others. Psychologists warn that overregulating emotions may cause mental health issues and weaken children’s social and adaptive skills.

                Parents and experts are calling for a reassessment of emotional control technologies to ensure they do not harm child development. The situation has sparked broader reflection on whether technological progress is silently eroding the freedom to express emotions.
